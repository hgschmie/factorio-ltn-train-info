# LTN Train Information combinator

Provides information about [Logistic Train Network (LTN)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LogisticTrainNetwork) deliveries to the logistic network:

- An signal for each item in a delivery. Can be quantity, stack count or just '1'.
- Virtual signals to denote whether the connected station is the requester or the provider of the delivery
- Delivery signals can be negated or divided by a constant.
- Signals can be configured separately for Requester and Provider.

Signals always reflect the delivery as scheduled by the LTN, not the inventory of the train.
